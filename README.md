# Installation

Credit goes to https://github.com/puckzxz/NotAnotherAnimeTheme for making 99% of this theme. I just modified a few things to better fit my taste.

## BetterDiscord

1. Open [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotsno/hotsno-discord-theme/main/bd/HotsnoBDTheme.theme.css) link, press Ctrl-S, and save to your `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\betterdiscord` folder.
2. (Optional) Right click the `HotsnoBDTheme.theme.css` file and click `Edit.` Edit the code using the comments for guidance to customize the theme to your liking.
3. In BetterDiscord, go to `Settings -> Themes` and toggle the `HotsnoBDTheme` theme.
4. Done.

## Powercord

1. Go to your Powercord themes folder (`C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\powercord\src\Powercord\themes` and create a new folder called `HotsnoPowercordTheme` or whatever you'd like. Keep this folder open.
2. Open [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotsno/hotsno-discord-theme/main/pc/powercord_manifest.json) and [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotsno/hotsno-discord-theme/main/pc/theme.css) link, press Ctrl-S, and save both to the folder you just made.
3. (Optional) Right click the `theme.css` file and click `Edit.` Edit the code using the comments for guidance to customize the theme to your liking.
4. If not already working, in Powercord, go to `Settings -> Theme Toggler` (you have to have the Theme Toggler plugin) and toggle the `HotsnoPowercordTheme` theme.
5. Done.

## Web

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension or look for an alternative to it for your browser.
2. Go to [this](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/423600-hotsno-discord-web-theme) link and press `Install`.
3. Done.
